## Considerations
- What is your product pitch?
   * Have you even been so hungry but once you look in your fridge you can't think of anything to make. FeedMe will take in the ingredients you currently have and searches for recipes with those specfic ingredients. 
- Who are the key stakeholders for this app?
   * Our app is will help those who have a strict budget to follow who cannot waste any money. 
- What are the core flows? 
    * The key functionality of our app is going to be searching, filtering, and displaying recipes.  For now, the user will be able to see   two screens. The first screen will display a list of recipes along with a search bar on top. As for the second screen, it will be       displayed once the user has picked a recipe from the first screen.  Also, the second screen will have a detail view showing the steps   needed to complete the meal.

- What will your final demo look like? 
    * For first time users, they will take a small survey asking them what types of food do they like. Once they complete the survey, users   will be shown a list of recommended foods based on the survey they took. On the screen listing recipes, users will have the ability to   search through the different recipes. Finally, the user will have the ability to see a detail view of the recipe selected; show the     necessary steps needed to complete the meal.
- What mobile features do you leverage?
   * The application feature that we leverage is searchability.  
- What are your technical concerns?
   * Currently, we do not have any technical concerns.
